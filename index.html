        <h1>Project on Consol</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Go, Node. js, Python and C++. It is based on the Electron framework, which is used to develop Node. js Web applications that run on the Blink layout engine.</p>
        <p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers. To open the developer console in Microsoft Edge, open the Edge Menu in the upper-right-hand corner of the browser window and select F12 Developer Tools. You can also press F12 to open it. The console will either open up within your existing Edge window, or in a new window. You may have to select the Console tab.</p>
